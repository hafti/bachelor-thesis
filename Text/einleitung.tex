\section{Introduction}\raggedbottom 

QANet is a state of the art neural network for solving the question answering problem with a single which does not use any recurrent neural nets(RNN) as most of the other state of the art approaches. As RNNs take a lot of time to train this is a advantage in performance. I am trying to use this new architecture in a chatbot where state of the art models use RNNs to see what performance improvement is reached by this.
